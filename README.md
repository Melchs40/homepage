# homepage

This is the final CSS/HTML project for The Odin Project. The purpose of this project is to create a responive webpage using what I have learned throughout the course. It's meant to be look good on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The webpage will be a portfolio for prior projects I have made in this course. I will be able to show this to prospective employers to demonstrate the work I've done during my time with The Odin Project.
